###[500 Ducks](http://500ducks.com)
A fast reverse image search engine for [500px.com](http://500px.com) I
initially built during the [Pixel Hack Day](http://pixelhackday.com), and kept
on working to improve it. This search engine is capable of finding
near-duplicates photos (for e.g., watermarked and with text overlay), as well
as photos that are similiar. Search speed and quality, UI improvements are
actively being developed.
