Kay Zhu is a software engineer in the Virtual Reality group at Google. He occasionally refers himself in third
person.


When he's not sitting in front of a computer, you can find him watching movies
in theatres, practicing judo, cycling/snowboarding on the mountains, or <del>playing
with his cat at home</del> (see you on the other side of the rainbow bridge, Pp).
